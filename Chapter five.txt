I wanted to smack him but I did'nt I figuerd he was telling the truth which made me rethink my whole life. Even though I have'nt even gotten a chance to live it yet. "wait so you were'nt trying to kill me the whloe time?" I said. "no of course not, did it really take this long for you to finally realize that?" said Percy. "so were good then right?" "yeah but were's Victoria?" "what do you mean?" Then I noticed she was gone. I thought she went to calss or the libary. But Percy thought she got abducted by something. It was possible, it could be that she got abducted to lure me in cause they knew I would go try to save her. "do you think we should try to look for her?" I asked. "we? you just found out that your an ocean daughter and you already think you know how to harvest control over your powers?" said Percy. "well perhaps I could learn as we go" "yeah no i'll take you somewhere where no one goes so I can tech some basics about being what you are but your not even close to trying to save people" Then I felt my shirt tug and I was pulled back. Then I saw pitch black again. I wondered how many times I have to be knocked out this week cause this was like the tenth time. When I got up me, Percy, and Victoria were tied to a huge rock. "OH COME ON, NOT AGAIN!" yelled Percy. "wait this happend to you before?" I asked "yeah, like five times it has" " so then you know how to get us out of this, right?" "I think so, its different every time" Then I realized thats where Victoria was the whole time. At least we found her. Now we just had to get out of here safely but I could tell that was going to be hard. Three people with only one person that knows how to deal with a stuiation like this but we could all get killed at any second now.
