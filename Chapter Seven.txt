He also told me that when we esaped the hospital and went back home that he yelled at his director and even tried to start a fight with him. even though it was all ok now and he got fired right after the insident. He somehow tracked him down and attacked him. No wonder his arms were a little brusied up. But the most important thing is that were all ok in the end. I also asked him why did they put him in a dark and cold room instead of the beds like ours. He said they told him that he wasent as bad as us and that he did'nt need care so they just locked him up until he woke up. I thought that was a little messed up but I did'nt really feel the need to di anything about it.
