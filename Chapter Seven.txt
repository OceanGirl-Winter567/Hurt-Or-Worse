  When I got back to my house everything was still the same. Only my mom was moved to the couch. 
  "I called them their on their way idiot!" I told Victoria.
  "ummm yeah your gonna need to step away for now Mar" Percy told me.]
  "and why?" I asked him.
  THen he got upset that I wasn't coperating with him so he had to drag me out which was the probably the hugest mistake that he could make in the moment. Because soon after me and him were outside all the rain that was fallling outside gathered up and made sit on it and it carried me away, far away.
