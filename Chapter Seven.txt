  When I got back to my house everything was still the same. Only my mom was moved to the couch. 
  "I called them their on their way idiot!" I told Victoria.
  "ummm yeah your gonna need to step away for now Mar" Percy told me.
  "and why?" I asked him.
  Ten he got upset that I wasn't coperating with him so he had to drag me out which was the probably the hugest mistake that he could make in the moment. Because soon after me and him were outside all the rain that was fallling outside gathered up and made sit on it and it carried me away, far away. This is the second time something like this has happend and now I was the one that was furious. Now I wanted to hurt someone, mainly Victoria. 
  "WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU POSIDIEN!?" Percy shouted in all his anger.
  "maybe he just hates you and likes me more" I replied feeling both anger and fear.
  "NO THIS I'SNT POSSIBLE I MET HIM LIKE THREE OR FOUR TIMES YOU AREN'T EVEN HIS DAUGHTER BECAUSE HE ONLY HAS SON'S!" Percy yelled.
  "WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PERCY, EVER SIENCE THE INSIDENT WITH YOUR CAMP DIRECTOR YOU'VE BEEN ACTING REALLY WEIRD, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?" I yelled at Percy with all of my courage, anger, and strenghth. 
  I still hate him for everything that he's caused ever sience that one day. When I finally got home I found Victoria crying even more emotionally now. 
  "hows's mom?" I asked
  "SHE'S DEAD NOW BECAUSE OF YOU!" she responded.
  "what? no she can't be!" I said thinking Victoria was trying to make me feel bad for taking so long.
  "YES SHE CAN BE AND SHE IS AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU! IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPPEND!" yelled Victoria before running out of the house with swolen eyes.
  I tried to run after her but guess who had to get in my way... Percy again.
  "OH MY- WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME PERCY I'M TRYING TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT WITH EVERYONE AND YOU'RE JUST RUINING IT, YOU'RE RUINING ME!" I yelled at Percy thinking that would make him realize what he'd done to me.
  "OH I'M THE ONE RUINING YOU? YOU SHOULD RETHINK YOUR WHOLE LIFE FIRST BEFORE SAYING THINGS LIKE THAT THEN COME BACK AND TELL ME ALL ABOUT HOW I'M SUCH A BAD PERSON WILL YA!" Percy yelled at the top of his lungs.
