When Percy told me that when we esaped the hopital he said that he tracked down his dirctor that got fired roght after the scene. He even tried to start a fight with him. Surprisingly Percy won, I guess he was angry enough to beat him. Apperently hes back on Olypus where he was born and raised. I told him that when we got out that I had an encounter with his dad. I felt bad lying but he deserved it and I did'nt want to be known as the "ordenariy" one. So I said that his dad was walking by and I said hi. Then he just looked at me like he knew me. Then I said that I walked up to him and asked if he was Percy's dad. I got a feeling Percy was starting to see what was really going on. So I tried to change the subject. Then Victoria called me sounding very scard. "hello?" I said. Then she told me about a killer on the loose and that I need to come home like right now. When I got home Victoria was relived but still scard. She showed me a picture of them. I swear they looked like Percy with the same haircut. same type of clothing. and same hand in the pocket like he does all the time. I though "could it be him?" But I did'nt think too much about it otherwise I might jump to the conclution that it is him. But when I went to bed that night I coulde'nt stop thinking about how simmiler Percy and the killer looked. It honestly could have been Posiden. The image showed a grown man with wet hair but I could tell what his haircut looked like. Which looked exactly like Percy's, it was so identicle. His clothes were very simmilar to Percy's and when I heard him talk on tv the next day his voice sounded just like him.
