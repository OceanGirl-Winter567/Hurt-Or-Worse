  A few days gone by and i'm still heartbroken. No one has tried to talk to me seince the incident with my mom and all. But eversience it happend I've been feeling a very strong evil growing inside of me. Almost like a "I'm ready to change myself" kind. Not really the "I'm gonna take over the world" kind.
