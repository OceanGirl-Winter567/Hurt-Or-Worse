  Hey! There you are! i've been waiting for you to read this book for ages. Let's get started shall we? First, my name: Lydia. i am 9 years old right now and have two friends which you'll meet later. Anyways, i'm working on a project right now the project is that i have to glue in my school picture on to the front of my folder. Not that hard right? Well the only thing is they want me to use liquid glue and I don't have that. But its not my fault they didn't put it on the school supplies list i just follwed what it said! And my teacher is going to get really mad at me for it. i've already been late at least 5 times and turned in homework late 2 times. She also gets mad at me when i forget to do a uppercase letter for my name or something. "Lydia time to go!" thats my mom, i forgot it was 8 in the morning let's go!
  "so i hear your struggling with your writing skills" my mom telles me. "well my teacher always gets mad at me for forgetting to do something in my sentences" i say. Also its my birthday in 1 month so lucky me right?
  "bye Lydia!" my mom yelled as she drove away. I already wanna go home because of my teacher ms a. Everyone makes fun of me for it and i don't like it. Oh no! the bell rang! i have to get to class! 
  "ok everybody what is the square root of PI?" my teacher asked the whole class. We all said i don't know and that made her annoyed. "you guys still don't know?" she was looking at me when she said that. i got scard and hid under my desk.
  "hey! get outta there!" my teacher yelled.
