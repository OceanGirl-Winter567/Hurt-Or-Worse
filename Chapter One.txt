   Ok but I didn't even know I was going to cause the fighting between both America's. I thought I was just doing the world a favor by telling the truth to everyone about how messed up this world is. I mean, people are mentally crazy and need help, or hadn't delt with their childhood trauma, or wanna go to prison. But, I needed to spread the word around here. If no one else is going to do it then I will, it just had to be said with no sugar-coating ok? So cut me some slack! Oh, you don't even know what I'm talking about do you? Sorry let me tell you. You probably know me as R-E-D but that's not who I really am. My real name is Scarlett Ivy. People like to call me poisin Ivy sometimes too. Anyways, I'm skipping a week of school for this so you better not come for me. I'll tell you more when I'm done meeting with my friends
