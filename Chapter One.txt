Know this before you know what crazy things i've seen. I'm an ocean daughter but when I found out, I wanted to denie it so many times. I even tried to run away to a whole new contry ans change my idendity. But I got caught sneaking out that night. Anyways, if you want to be an ocean daughter I seggest you stick to your normal life. Don't try to do any spells or anything like that even the ones you find on the internet that probably don't even work. But if you really want to know what being an ocean daughter if like the i'll tell you. I am Marina Delmar fourth dautgher of the sea. I am a very ambitious and kind. I always go with the flow when it comes to just about anything. Weather its what the class wants to ethier go outside for our freetime or if we should audition for chior with me and a few friends. But heres my real story. One day I was just walking to school like any other day but on that day something felt different. I did'nt exacly feel like I was safe but I just ignored it. once I got to school theres normaly a 20 minute wait so I called Victoria ( my best friend sience 7th grade) When she picked up the phone I Victoria. "yeah hurry up" I replied. But she already hung up. Luckily she got there just in time. "you really need to try getting here earlier. I said "I know but I always find a way to be late I guess" said Victoria. At first period I felt like the teachers were'ent really themselves. They were acting very protective twards me for some reason and so was Victoria. During my Spainish class something about this teacher felt even more off then the others. Almost like their keeping a close eye on me even though I have'nt done anything that i'm aware of. Finally she said "Marina will you please step out for a moment with me" It was at that moment I got so scared because i've never been called like this before. This was so scary I thought I was gonna get suspended for no reason just because they were annoyed that I was there. "please miss I did'nt do anything please don't kick me out for the rest of the week. "no no i'm not gonna do that I just wanted to talk to you about something in privet" The more she spoke the more nervous I got. I thought she was gonna tell me that I was some hybrid goddess superhoro thing like in the books  "Percy Jackson and the Olympians" ( A real sieres I read) When Victoria saw that I was gone she went looking for me thinking "did she find out whats going on this never happend to her before" Then she ran off looking for me like she was gonna die if she did'nt find me in the next five seconds or so.
