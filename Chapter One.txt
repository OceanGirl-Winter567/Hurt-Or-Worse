Know this before you know what crazy things i've seen. I'm an ocean daughter but when I found out, I wanted to denie it so many times. I even tried to run away to a whole new contry ans change my idendity. But I got caught sneaking out that night. Anyways, if you want to be an ocean daughter I seggest you stick to your normal life. Don't try to do any spells or anything like that even the ones you find on the internet that probably don't even work. But if you really want to know what being an ocean daughter if like the i'll tell you. I am Marina Delmar fourth dautgher of the sea. I am a very ambitious and kind. I always go with the flow when it comes to just about anything. Weather its what the class wants to ethier go outside for our freetime or if we should audition for chior with me and a few friends. But heres my real story. One day I was just walking to school like any other day but on that day something felt different. I did'nt exacly feel like I was safe but I just ignored it.
