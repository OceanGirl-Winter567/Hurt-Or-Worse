  Ok, now i'm stuck in the middle of the road, luckly there's a middle part that i'm in. But, how do I get home from here? Oviously you wouldn't know.
  "hey! why'd you jump out the car?" yelled out Evenya.
  I just ran. Yeah, that wasn't a good idea, I got hit...just kidding I made it to the side walk and started running. I didn't know where I was going, but suddenly my legs felt like they were frozen to the ground.
  "oh my gosh! What now?" I yelled.
  "now your coming home" I heard someone wisper in my ear.
  I knew that voice, it was percy.
  I tried to punch him even though I knew he's know as the strong one, like I care. (Also Rick Riordan if your ever going to read this I just want to let you know i'm not trying to copywrite anything and by taking some of your characters and stuff i'm trying to give you credit because your stories are amazing and very addictive coming from the author of this story herself)
  "ow! What was that for?" 
  "i'll give you three guesses and here's a hint your ruined my life in unimaginable ways percy i'm done with you!"
  I tried to walk away but he stood infront of me.
  "oh my- what do you want from me!"
  "I want to help you Maraina"
  "how many times do I have to say it your not helping"
