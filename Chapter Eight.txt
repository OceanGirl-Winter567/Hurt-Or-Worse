  As soon as I heard that I had so much regret and ran off hoping to get hit by a car or something. But my luck seems to come whenever I have a moment like that. Sometimes I wonder why all of my friends are the ones who seem to get mad at me the most times. But i'm not goning to change the subject here.
  Anyway, I found my phone and ran home stright away before anyone else could get in my way. But I stopped in my tracks because I saw something glow in the corner of my eye and ran twards that instead. I know what your thinking "do you really not like your mom so much that you get so distracted from her?"
  But the real answer to why i got distracted from her is because I had really no one left and all I wanted were answers to just about everything. I ran to it with all the power I had and felt like I was flying for a second. Everyone just stared at me but I did'nt care. I thought I could touch it but what was I thinking it was only light not a real object. Then a random girl ran into me. She looked exsuasted from something. 
  "Hey! don't just run into people like that have'nt you been taught anything?" I told her.
  "i'm so sorry I was going after something, this i'snt even the universe I live in" she said very scared.
