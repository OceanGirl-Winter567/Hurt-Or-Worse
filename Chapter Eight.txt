  As soon as I heard that I had so much regret and ran off hoping to get hit by a car or something. But my luck seems to come whenever I have a moment like that. Sometimes I wonder why all of my friends are the ones who seem to get mad at me the most times. But i'm not going to change the subject here.
  Anyway, I found my phone and ran home stright away before anyone else could get in my way. But I stopped in my tracks because I saw something glow in the corner of my eye and ran towards that instead. I know what your thinking "do you really not like your mom so much that you get so distracted from her?"
  But the real answer to why I got distracted from her is because I had really no one left and all I wanted were answers to just about everything. I ran to it with all the power I had and felt like I was flying for a second. Everyone just stared at me but I didn't care. I thought I could touch it but what was I thinking it was only light not a real object.
  "hey! wait! come back!" I called out.
  I kept running on and on knocking everyone in my path. Eventually Victoria called me, so I stopped to answer.
  "hello?" I said.
  "FOR THE LAST TIME MARINA, WHERE ARE YOU?" she yelled.
  "I got distracticed, i'll be there in like ten minutes!" I told her.
  "oh, its too late for that, mom is dead now" 
  "NO!"
  "yes Marina yes and to think its because her own daughter couldn't get there in time to get help"
  "your kidding and this i'snt something to joke around about"
  "I wish I was but also this was kind of your fault, you killed her because you didn't get here fast enough and i'm not going to be friends with a killer and I knew I should've done this a long time ago but I'm done being friends with you Marina Delmar"
  Once I heard her say that, I knew that I would have a whole new life at school and outside of school. And on top of that my mom died without me. I wasn't even there during her last moments. I was just gone when she died.
