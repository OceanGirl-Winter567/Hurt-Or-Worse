But depite what we'd look like we did it. Luckily they got out and I went home but Percy, thats a different story. The next day I did'nt see Percy at school today. Probably cause we ended up resolving this whole thing after all. But i'm stil never going back there again. Or am I now that I found out i'm an ocean daughter and all, even if I have to go back I would make a big sceen about it and would be quiet but still cry if I do end up going. At school I could'ent stop thinking about what happend the last week or so. I missed three days of school and the few days and when did go I was a huge mess. Everyone was probably worried about me. When I entered I felt akward and everyone was running up to me like I was dead and came back to life. I hate attention like that and that was only the start of school not even first period yet. I immeaditly wanted go home but my home wasent exactly my home anymore. My mom was probably freaking out. I heard there was a search party in the middle of town the same day I left. That was probably for me and if I were to come home randomly my mom would probably have a heart attack. 
The last thing I would want is another person in danger at all. wether its health resons or a kiddnapping I don't want another person in danger. Later after the first half of the day there was a fight in the hallway that no one even the teachers tried to stop. Sometimes I wonder if i'm just seeing things that look like teachers or if their really that bad at their job.
