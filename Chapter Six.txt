But depite what we'd look like we did it. Luckily they got out and I went home but Percy, thats a different story. The next day I did'nt see Percy at school today. Probably cause we ended up resolving this whole thing after all. But i'm stil never going back there again. Or am I, now that I found out i'm an ocean daughter and all, even if I have to go back I would make a big sceen about it and would be quiet but still cry in the car, if I do end up going. At school I could'ent stop thinking about what happend in the last week or so. I missed three days of school and the few days and when did go I was a huge mess. Everyone was probably worried about me. When I entered I felt akward and everyone was running up to me like I was dead and just came back to life. I hate attention like that and that was only the start of school not even first period yet. I immeaditly wanted go home but my home wasent exactly my home anymore. My mom was probably freaking out. I heard there was a search party in the middle of town the same day I left. That was probably for me and if I were to come home randomly my mom would probably have a heart attack. After the first half of the day there was a fight in the middle of the hallway. The worst part is that there was teachers but they just stood there and watched. Sometimes I wonder if there are teachers there or if i'm just seeing things. After school I was really board. I felt like I was melting away, but i've never felt that way before. Victoria was hwlping my mom out with something. I felt like I should probably help out to. She was moving stuff around. The couches, tables, everything. Fianlly I came down and helped out, at least that gave me something to do. While I was helping her pick something up she told me to stay there for a moment after we were done. She wanted to talk to me about something. I could sense it had somthing to with me and Percy. Probably how we ended up tied to a rock. I had to come up with a lie. If I told her how we really ended up there she would either get all wired or start screaming at me like a mainiac. I Honestly don't think "mainiac" is really the right word but I can't think of any other way to explain her. I get she was trying to protect me but sometimes it gets out of hand. When we were done I got nervous about what I would say if asks me about where me and Victoria were we were the whole time, and maybe why I was with Percy for so long. "so, how do you feel?" asked my mom. I did'nt think she would ask me something so simple after all thats happend. But I answered with "i'm fine why?" "oh no reason just wondering" After that I was a little suspitious of her. Even though I probably should have been more focused on myself and my friends. they were the ones that were there when we got tied to the rock. They were the ones who were there when me and Percy were fighting. They are always there right beside me. Not my mom. I feel like my mom never understood me and I never understood her either. So i'm not mad about that. Later that night Percy called me and told me to meet up at the public libary tommorw. Since we both agreed that I wasent going back to his camp any time soon. I just told him to meet up now cause his voice sounded serious. Luckly he said thats fine. When we meet he told me that I will have to go somewhere simmilar to his place. Or even just his place. But he said that his director got fired right after he pushed me and that a god themself had to take over. I wasent that surpried that they would do something like that.
