  I would normally take my friends home, but I didn't really see him as a friend or really trust him anymore. I took him to some random guys place and said I'll be right back. I just left! I ordered a ride home until I saw Evenya pull up with my car right infront of me, so I canceled the ride and got in to my car.
  "oh my gosh ev what did you do to my car" I said as I saw she trashed my car.
  "oops sorry I'll clean it up when we get home" she told me.
  "fine but you better not be bluffing" I warned her.
  Percy wanted to get in the car too, I didn't want him to join us. Though, I had to let him in because if I didn't, he would know I'm lying. I was quiet for as long as I could possibly be. Until Percy wanted to say something, I didn't even listen. But of course Evenya did. I stole his pen and cut open his shirt and threw the pen infront of him.
  "hey! what was that for?" He asked. By the way the car was overly air conditioned. 
  "oh I don't know maybe because he's a traitor" I said while sarcasticly smiling.
  "You know what, were close enough to your place, get out!" Evenya yelled.
  She pulled over right there.
