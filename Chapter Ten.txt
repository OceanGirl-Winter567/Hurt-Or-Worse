  After a few months of working on a certain achivement I decided it was time for a break. So I took myself out on a trip to Hawaii for a few weeks. It was going great until I got a call from Victoria.
  "hello?" I answered not knowing who it was. 
  "hey Marina I don't know if you remember me but I just wanted to say please don't do what it looks like you might do" she asked me desprately.
  "um, who is this?" I asked.
  "your old friend Victoria" 
  "AND YOUR CALLING ME NOW? AFTER MONTHS SIENCE IT HAPPEND! NOW?"
  "yes I know its probably a very akward time right now but-"
  "YEAH RIGHT NOW! EVER SIENCE THEN ITS BEEN AKWARD AND YOUR CALLING ME NOW!" 
  I hung up on her when someone who looked about sixteen walked up to me and asked me if I was ok. I was a little annoyed but I had the same vibe from her as I used to get from Victoria back when we were best friends. So I asked her name and she said it was Evanya. I told her who I was and then I ended up spending my whole rest of my trip with her. 
  We joked around about that thing that I acually will do, but she doesn't and will never know.
